## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->
A Mother's breast:        
Safe refuge from her childish fears,          
From childish troubles, childish tears,         
Mists that enshroud her dawning years!       
see how in sleep she seems to sing.       
A voiceless psalm--an offering.     

## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->

## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->

## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem you created using chatGPT of 20 to 30 lines,here!-->
Amidst the stars, a dreamscape unfolds,     
Where night's embrace, in wonder, holds.      
Whispers of time, woven in the skies,      
A dance of constellations, a cosmic prize.     

Moonlight bathes the world in tender glow,      
Secrets of the universe it starts to show.     
Each twinkling diamond, a story to tell,     
In the vast celestial tapestry, they dwell.     

Galaxies like rivers, flowing through space,     
Mysteries and wonders, we eagerly chase.     
So gaze upon the heavens, let your spirit roam,     
In this celestial ballet, find your heart's true home.
