## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->
A Mother's breast:        
Safe refuge from her childish fears,          
From childish troubles, childish tears,         
Mists that enshroud her dawning years!       
see how in sleep she seems to sing.       
A voiceless psalm--an offering.     

## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,      
And sorry I could not travel both.     
And be one traveler, long I stood.     
And looked down one as far as I could.     
To where it bent in the undergrowth;   

## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->

The sun was shining on the sea,    
Shining with all his might:    
He did his very best to make.    
The billows smooth and bright-     
And this was odd, because it was.   
The middle of the night.    

The moon was shining sulkily,      
Because she thought the sun.     
Had got no business to be there.   
After the day was done-     
"It's very rude of him," she said,    
"To come and spoil the fun!"     

## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem you created using chatGPT of 20 to 30 lines,here!-->
Amidst the stars, a dreamscape unfolds,     
Where night's embrace, in wonder, holds.      
Whispers of time, woven in the skies,      
A dance of constellations, a cosmic prize.     

Moonlight bathes the world in tender glow,      
Secrets of the universe it starts to show.     
Each twinkling diamond, a story to tell,     
In the vast celestial tapestry, they dwell.     

Galaxies like rivers, flowing through space,     
Mysteries and wonders, we eagerly chase.     
So gaze upon the heavens, let your spirit roam,     
In this celestial ballet, find your heart's true home.
